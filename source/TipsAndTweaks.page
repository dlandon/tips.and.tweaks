	<strong><p>The first thing you should do is to install the "Fix Common Problems" plugin to find and fix
	common problems.  Correct any problems that are identified before doing any 'tweaking'.  You may actually cause
	more problems than you solve if there are problems with your unRaid configuration.</p>
	<p>Make one change at a time and verify if it improves your situation.  Make changes slowly.  Making changes here can can briefly interrupt your network operation.  Some of the settings will consume RAM and may end up causing Linux to terminate some processes to free up RAM.</p>

	> Some Recommendations:
	>
	> + Use a static IP address for your unRaid server.  Be sure you reserve the IP address on your router, or set a very high IP address to prevent conflicts.
	> + Don't use Jumbo Frames.
	> + Don't set vm.dirty.ratio above 20% unless you have a UPS backup for your unRaid.  You may lose data that has not been written to disk on a power failure.
	> + Don't set vm.dirty_background_ratio over 1/2 of vm.dirty_ratio.

	Disable NIC Flow Control?

		<?=mk_option($tips_and_tweaks_cfg['FLOW_CONTROL'], "no", "No");?>
		<?=mk_option($tips_and_tweaks_cfg['FLOW_CONTROL'], "yes", "Yes");?>

	> Set to 'Yes' to disable NIC Flow Control.  NIC Flow Control was originally implemented to help in
	> networks with mixed speed devices.  It doesn't seem to be as necessary on today's networks.  If you
	> have a managed switch, flow control can generally be turned on and off on the switch.  If you have
	> a consumer grade switch, you won't have that level of control.  Flow Control has been known to create
	> network issues in certain circumstances.  It is recommended to disable Flow Control.

	Disable NIC Offload?

		<?=mk_option($tips_and_tweaks_cfg['TSO_OFFLOAD'], "no", "No");?>
		<?=mk_option($tips_and_tweaks_cfg['TSO_OFFLOAD'], "yes", "Yes");?>
	  </select>

	> Set to 'Yes' to disable NIC TSO.  TSO (Transmit Segment Offload) was developed to offload some
	> network processing to the NIC and off the main CPU.  This was intended to save some CPU processing
	> load.  TSO has been known to cause network issues in certain circumstances.  It is recommended to
	> disable NIC Offload.
