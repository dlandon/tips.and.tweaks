	<p>The Tips below are suggestions, workarounds for known problems, and potential fixes.  It is recommended that you update Unraid to the latest stable version to get the latest features, bug fixes, and security updates.  Support for older versions of Unraid is being phased out.  Many plugins are no longer compatible with older Unraid versons.</p>
	<p><u>All versions</u></p>
	<li>Install the "Fix Common Problems" plugin and resolve any Unraid configuration problems.</il>
	<li>Use the Update Assistant that is part of the Fix Common Problems plugin.  This will identify potential problems to be solved before you upgrade the Unraid OS.</li>
	<li>Check the <u><a href='http://lime-technology.com/wiki/index.php/Tips_and_Tweaks', target='_blank'>Tips and Tweaks wiki</a></u> for additional ideas on improving your Unraid performance and solving problems.</li>
	<li>Some have reported better VM performance with media streaming and gaming VMs with the suggestions on this <u><a href='http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=49051.0', target='_blank'>post</a></u>.</li>
	<li>Some have reported faster and more consistent network performance by making changes in networking parameters on the 'Tweaks' tab of this plugin.</li>
	<li>If you have an Intel Processor, it may appear that all CPUs are constantly running at full speed.  They may show full speed, but the scaling governor is working properly.  Read this <u><a href='http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=36575.0', target='_blank'>post</a></u> for information on the issue.  It is recommended to use the pstate driver on Intel processors if you want the most performance.  Note: The dashboard shows CPU loading and not CPU frequency.  You can check CPU frequencies on the command line with 'watch grep \"cpu MHz\" /proc/cpuinfo'.</li>
	<li>If you configure VLANs on Unraid, you should make Unraid the Master Browser.  If you don't Unraid may not detect the Master Browser for all network interfaces correctly.</li>
	<li>Some people are reporting OOM (out of memory) errors.  This seems to be occurring more now because of the large amounts of memory being installed in Unraid and the default Disk Cache settings defaulting too high.  If you are experiencing OOM errors, try adjusting the Disk Cache settings on the Tweaks page.</li>
