	<p>The Tips below are suggestions, workarounds for known problems, and potential fixes for different versions of unRAID.</p>
	<p><u>All v6 versions</u></p>
	<li>Install the "Fix Common Problems" plugin and resolve any unRAID configuration problems.</il>
	<li>Check the <u><a href='http://lime-technology.com/wiki/index.php/Tips_and_Tweaks', target='_blank'>Tips and Tweaks wiki</a></u> for additional ideas on improving your unRAID performance and solving problems.</li>
	<li>Some have reported better VM performance with media streaming and gaming VMs with the suggestions on this <u><a href='http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=49051.0', target='_blank'>post</a></u>.</li>
	<li>Some have reported faster and more consistent network performance by making changes in networking parameters on the 'Tweaks' tab of this plugin.</li>
	<li>If you have an Intel CPU, it may appear that all cpus are constantly running at full speed.  The dashboard will show full speed on the cpus, but the scaling governor is probably working properly.  Read this <u><a href='http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=36575.0', target='_blank'>post</a></u> for information on the issue.  It is recommended to use the pstate driver on Intel processors if you want the most performance and then just ignore the dashboard display of frequencies.  Note: The dashboard shows CPU loading and not CPU frequency in 6.2.  You can check CPU frequencies on the command line with 'watch grep \"cpu MHz\" /proc/cpuinfo'.</li>
	<p><u>6.1.9</u></p>
	<li>Apply the fix on the the <u><a href='http://lime-technology.com/wiki/index.php/Tips_and_Tweaks', target='_blank'>Tips and Tweaks wiki</a></u> for the 'Fix SMART database update'.</li>
	<p><u>6.2</u></p>
	<li>None.</li>
	<p><u>6.3 and 6.4</u></p>
	<li>If you configure VLANs on unRAID, you should make unRAID the Master Browser.  If you don't unRAID may not detect the Master Browser for all network interfaces correctly.</li>
	<li>Some people are reporting OOM (out of memory) errors in 6.4.  This seems to be occurring more now because of the large amounts of memory being installed in unRAID and the default disk cache settings defaulting too high.  If you are experiencing OOM errors try adjusting the Disk Cache settings on the Tweaks page.</li>
