> Some General Recommendations:
>
> + Use of a static IP address can help in certain cases.  NFS shares are referenced by IP address.  Be sure you reserve the IP address on your router, or set a very high IP address to prevent conflicts.
> + Use of Jumbo Frames is discouraged.  Jumbo Frames have been known to cause issues with some Dockers.
> + Don't set vm.dirty.ratio above 20% unless you have a UPS backup for your Unraid.  You may lose data that has not been written to disk on a power failure.
> + A value of vm.dirty_background_ratio over 1/2 of vm.dirty_ratio is not recommended unless using single digits for both values.
